After bouncing around different ideas for a career path, starting off wanting to be a big time New York lawyer to working for the government as an actuary for a summer, I have recently been on the wave of Cybersecurity,
and I believe this is the path that I will stick with.

I have always been interested in computers, whether that is building them (as I built my first desktop at 12) or working within them (such as when I build my first minecraft mod shortly after I built that computer). 
Cybersecurity felt like the perfect balance between my affinity for computer and IoT along with my analytical skills, built from years of working on mathematical and philosophical puzzles, and diplomatic skills 
from my time participating in Debate and Model UN. 

In my effort to find a job in Cybersecurity, I am not only studying for certifications (right now I am studying for the COMPTIA Security+ exam) but also working on projects to broaden my knowledge of concepts
that will be applicable as I learn more about cybersecurity. 

From my research, blockchain technology is a rising trend within cybersecurity, allowing for companies to keep track of exchanges securely, without having to rely on outdated technologies. This peaked my interest and, 
as a learner, made me want to understand blockchain technology better. I already had a basic understanding of how blockchain works yet I never dove in to the details of it. That is my goal with this project, to create
a blockchain for myself that I can tinker with as I learn more. I have a goal of making an immutable audit log (as of 12.23.2024) and I hope I can reach my goal by the end of break (1.8.2025). I will use this as a journal 
to keep track of my day-by-day progress and hold myself accountable to my project.
